# Sleep-ObjectOriented-Analysis
This project processes .mat files created by sleep analysis code from Wilber Laboratory within subfolders of a given base folder. It extracts and summarizes relevant data from these files, and consolidates the results into a comprehensive structure. Additionally, it provides functionality to visualize data.

# MATLAB Subfolder Processing and Data Visualization

This project provides a MATLAB function to recursively process `.mat` files within subfolders of a specified base folder, summarize relevant data, and visualize specific subfields across different dates.

## Features

- **Recursive Subfolder Processing**: Automatically navigates through subfolders, extracts data from `.mat` files, and summarizes the results.
- **Summarized Results Struct**: Stores summarized data in a structured format, including custom functions for data calculation and visualization.
- **Visualization**: Offers plotting functions to visualize specific subfields across different dates, with options for line and bar graphs.
- **Custom Label Handling**: Ensures that field names with underscores are displayed correctly in plots without subscripting.
